### Inversion, anticyclone, and stable weather
- A continuing **temperature inversion** at valley vicinity means the mountains stay clear.
- An [inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(meteorology)) can be identified by mist in the valley whereas the mountains are clear. Above the mist, at higher attitudes or summit hight, the vision is good and you can see far.
- An inversion or temperature inversion is a meteorological conditions in which the normal change of an atmospheric property with altitude deviates. In normal conditions air temperature decreases with an increase in altitude. However, at times of an inversion, higher atmospheric layers are warmer than lower ones. Such an inversion traps smog, or mist, at lower levels and at proximity to the ground.
- At a stable [high pressure area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticyclone) (i.e. **anticyclone**) the valley area is divided from higher altitudes. The valley shows mist, whereas at the summit area the air is warm and clear resulting in vision that is very good. This is an inversion. Such continuous usually mean that the weather stays stable and clear in the mountains. Perfect weather for mountaineering.
