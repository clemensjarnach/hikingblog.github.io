# My Favourite Mountain Tours 
on https://clemensjarnach.github.io/hikingblog.github.io/

Welcome to my collection of favourite mountain tours, climbs, scrambles, ski-tours, and places. As a mountain enthusiast, I've explored many beautiful and challenging routes, and I've created this website to document my personal experiences.

### Disclaimer

It's important to note that I am not a professional mountain guide, and the routes described on this website are not intended to be a substitute for professional guidance. Everyone is responsible for their own safety and should judge their own skill level before attempting any of the tours or climbs listed on this website. I am providing this information purely for personal reference and as a way to share my experiences with others.

### Navigation

The website is divided into several categories, each representing a different type of mountain activity. You can browse the categories by using the navigation bar at the top of the page.

Each tour or climb has a separate page, which includes a description of the route, photos, and a list of important links. I've also included personal notes on each tour, which highlight any particularly challenging sections or special features that I found particularly memorable.

### Contact

If you have any questions, comments, or recommendations, please feel free to contact me. You can reach me via email or through my social media profiles, which you can find on my profile page.

### Social Media

I'm also active on Instagram and YouTube, where I post photos and videos of my mountain adventures. You can find me on Instagram as [@clemensthelemon](https://www.instagram.com/clemensthelemon/?hl=en) or on [YouTube as Clemens Jarnach](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLBGu9MdRPb8iyDJFjxwdOw)



Remember to always prioritize safety and to plan your trips accordingly. Happy exploring!
