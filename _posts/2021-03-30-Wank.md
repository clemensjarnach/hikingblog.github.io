**Character:** Easy but strenuous ski-tour. FYI: the same path via the forest road can be a nice spring hike when there is not enough snow for skiing and too much snow for other hikes.

The ski-tour follows the forest road that leas up to the Wank summit and Alpenvereinshütte via the old ski-slope. Thus, it is a relatively safe route with low danger of snow avalanches, and provides easy skiing terrain while having some nice slopes.
The summit view is incredible and will rewards all exertions. You have a beautiful view to the entire Wetterstein plus Karwendel, Estergebierge and Ammergauer mountains. The Wank has one of the best views in the region and is always a good spot to enjoy the view, perhaps with a cold beer.


**Drive to base:**
Drive to Garmisch and follow signs to the Wankbahn parking lot. You can start the tour/hike right from the parking lot of the Wankbahn Talstation. (For navigation system: Wankbahnstraße, 82467 Garmisch-Partenkirchen)

**Route:**
Wankbahn Talstation (717hm) - Daxkapelle – Frauenmahdsattel – Esterbergalm (1264m) – Wank (1780m) – Ascent is the same as ascent. (variation: for the ascent you can take steep forest trail on the northside of the Wank, direction Wankröhre/Eckenberg)

## Logbook:



### Spring Hike with Snow - 30.03.2021 - Wank (1780m)
**Description:**
- Lauren and I hiked the Wank via the ski-touring route, i.e. the forest road due to a lot of snow on the mountain. The wank with its safe route via the forest road is a good early spring hike, when other mountains are still too snowy for a 'summer' hike.
- We started at 10:37 from the Wankbahn Talstation (717hm). we didi not take the normal summer hiking route on the south-east side of the wank bellow the cablecar. instead, we took the ski-touring route, on the forest path that goes around the mountain. i.e. Wankbahn Talstation (717hm) - Daxkapelle – Frauenmahdsattel – Esterbergalm (1264m) – Wank (1780m).
- We reached the summit after 3h of hiking. after 1h break on the top we started the descent via the ascent route.
- In total we hiked from 10:37 - 17:20, gained 1.086m vert, and walked a total of 20km.


### Ski Tour - March 2021 - Wank (1780m)
**Description:**
- I started at 09:42 from the Wankbahn Talstation (717hm) and followed the forest road to Daxkapelle and later followed the signs to ascent on the north side through the forest, direciton direction Wankröhre/Eckenberg. the forest ascent was nice but steep and exhausting.
- after 3h, I reached the summit of the Wank and took a long break to enjoy the incredible view.
- I skied down via the old skiing slopes. Thus, I skied down on the south-west side, direction Roßwank, and followed the broad path back to the Esterbergalm. From there I skied down the forest road until i reached the parking lot. Late in the spring the forest road can be free of snow and you will have to carry your skies for passages.
