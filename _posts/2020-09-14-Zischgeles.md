The Zischgeles (3004m) is a relatively easy 3000m peak located in the Stubaier Alpen. In the winter is the Zischgeles a very popular ski mountaineering mountain whereas in the summer it is a quiet mountain. It is a 3000m high mountain that can be reached without glacier contact. Although is an easier 3000m peak, the ascent should not be underestimated. Anyone wanting to summit this great mountain will need a good fitness, experience in the alps, and be able to do a bit of ridge climbing with some exposed sections (I). The summit rewards with an incredible view to the surrounding giants, such as the majestic Grubenwand (3173m), the Schöntalspitze (3002m), and the Lisenser Fernerkogel (3299m).

**Route:**
Praxmar (1700m) - Route 31 - Zischgeles North Ridge - Zischgeles Summit (3004m) - Descent same as Ascent.

Alternatively: you can do a loop by taking the Route 32 on the ascent and descent on Route 32. Traverse of the Oberstkogel (Route 32b) requires a fair bit of climbing in II degree. You can bypass the Oberstkogel Traverse by staying on Route 32 and g round the Oberstkogel on its south side.
