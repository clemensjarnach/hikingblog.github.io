**Drive to base:**
Address for car navigation: Mandlweg, 82488 Ettal, Deutschland

**Route:**
Ettal (875m) – Ettaler Manndl (1633m) – (optional: Laber (1686m)) – Ettal

**Character:**
The Ettaler Manndl (1633m) is a small rock peak in the Ammergauer Alpen. It is a quite popular destination since it is not too high, has a little scramble bit on the top (via-ferrata A/B), and has a great view from the top. I would recommend to avoid weekends or holidays unless you start very early. Do not underestimated the short climb to the summit. Use of via-ferrata equipment encouraged for less experienced climbers.

**Ascent:**
The hike to the rocky summit is easy. A nice trail leads up through the forest. It is a nice trail also for mountain runners especially on the way down. The summit can be reached only through climbing a little. It is a short scramble of 15 - 20 mins that is secured by steel-ropes / chains, and is a via-ferrata of class A/B . The summit can be climbed with via-ferrata equipment and less experienced hikers should bring a full via-ferrata gear.  The summit ascent shouldn't be underestimated - alpine dangers - risk of falling.
From the summit you will have a great and worthwhile view to the Wettersteingebirge, the Bayrischen Voralpen, and north to Ammersee and Starnbergersee.

**Descent:**
Same as Ascent.
