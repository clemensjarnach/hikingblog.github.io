The Zugspitze (2508m) is the highest mountain in the Wettersteingebierge and the highest mountain of Germany. As the highest point in Germany and with many intersting routes, plus several cable cars and the famous Zugspitzbahn (Bavarian Zugspitze Railway)is the mountain and summit quite busy. Nevertheless, any route up to the almost 3000 m high mountain is worthwhile. The Zugspitzmassiv lies south of the town Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the Austria-Germany border runs over its west summit.

The Zugspitze was first climbed on 27 August 1820 by Josef Naus, Maier, and Johann Georg Tauschl. Today there are  several routes to the summit: one from the Höllental valley to the northeast; another out of the Reintal valley to the southeast; one from the Ehrwalder Alm via the ‘Gatterl’, and one from the west over the Österreichische Schneekar and Stopselzieher. One of the best known ridge routes in the Eastern Alps runs along the knife-edged Jubiläumsgrat to the summit, linking the Zugspitze, the Hochblassen and the Alpspitze. For mountaineers there are a few huts. On the western summit of the Zugspitze itself is the Münchner Haus, on the western slopes is the Wiener-Neustädter Hut, and in the Höllental lies the Höllentalangerhütte.

To the summit run two cable cars: the Zugspitz-Seilbahn from the Eibsee and the Tiroler Zugspitzbahn from Ehrwald. Additionally runs the Bayerische Zugspitzbahn from Garmisch to the Zugspitzplatt.

This page descirbes the route to the Zugspitze from the Eibsee via Wiener-Neustädter Hütte, Österreichisches Schneekar, and
Stopselzieher.

**Video Description** [add link]

**Character:** The Lamsenspitze is an alpine mountaineering route of  medium difficulty (T3) with via ferrata sections 1) Normalweg (A-A/B), 2) Brudertunnel (B/C), and summit via-ferrata (B/C). Short sections to the summit without fixed rope (I).

This hike requires experience and a good head for heights due to exposed sections as well as experience in via-ferrata climbing.

**Drive to base:**
Address for car navigation: Hinterriß-Eng 1-2, 6215 Hinterriß, Austria. The parking lot of the hotel 'DIE ENG Alpengasthof und Naturhotel'.


**Ascent:**
From the parking lot of the Alpengasthof Eng you follow the signs to the Binsalm. A steep path starts just left after the 'Eng Alm' Gate. After the Binsalm you follow a small path that leads up a mountain field. The direction is always the Lamsenjoch / Lamsenjochhuette. Once you reach the Lamsenjoch, an almost horizontal path leads to the Lamsenjoch Hütte. From here you can already see the hut in the distance.

From the hut you have two options: 1) either you take the 'Normalweg' which leads up on crushed rocks (i.e. dt. Schotterfeld) right to the bottom of the East face (Ostwand). You cross the bottom of the East face and then an easy via-ferrata (A-A/B) leads to the Lamsenscharte. 2) Alternatively, you can take the exciting and slightly more difficult via-ferrata route via Brudertunnel (B/C). Both routes lead to the Lamsenscharte. From there you follow the path on loose rock (dt Geröllfeld) in West direction until you reach the access point of the via-ferrata for the summit ascent (B-B/C). Be careful of rock falls. Note. the via-ferrata to the summit of the lamsenspitze has been redirected and is now slightly more difficult, however, less exposed to rockfall. Old guides and books will say this via-ferat is easy (A-A/B), however, since 2020 is the grade more a (B/C-C).



**Descent:**
Descent as the same as the ascent. However, climbers who to the Brudertunnel Ferrata might want to take the Normalweg on the way down.
