The Kreuzspitze (2185m) is the highest summit in the Ammergauer Alpen. It is a nice alpine hike that shouldn’t be underestimated. This majestic mountain offers steep trails, lots of loose ground, rocks, climbing bits, and a wonderful view. 

**Map & Route Summary:**   [online at alpenvereinaktiv](https://www.alpenvereinaktiv.com/de/tour/kreuzspitze-2020-07-21/178843055/?share=%7Eznkpkcfb%244ossmphu)

**Route:**  Parkplatz Ammerwald (1080m) – Corss Riverbed, left hand side – Hochgrießkar – Kreuzspitze (2185m) – Descent same as Ascent

**Character:** The Kreuzspitze is an alpine mountaineering route of  medium-high difficulty (T3+) and requires short parts of climbing in the (I) degree. This tour requires alpine experience and a good head for heights.

**Drive to base:**
Address for car navigation: drive to  Linderhof, 82488 Ettal, but then you need to stay on the road, direction Plansee. 7km behind linderhof, just behind the boarder, is a parking area on the left side. Park here. Yellow sign directs to Klammspitze.

**Hike:**
- Park at Parkplatz Ammerwald (1080m) which lies on the left side of the road, approx. 7km behind Linderhof, and just behind the boarder.
- From the parking area follow the yellow sign to the Kreuzspitze. First cross the Riverbed (i.e. **Gries**) and find the trail on the **left** side of the Riverbed. A trail starts to lead into the forest.
- The first part in the forest is nice and not too steep.
- After not very long the path gets steeper and we hike up the forest in lots serpentines.
- Then you will reached the **Hochgrießkar** and the winding trail leads up the cirque (i.e.Kar) and it gets steeper and stony. Always follow the **red dots** and markings to stay on the trail.
- The paths leads out of the cirque into the mountain pine bushes (i.e. Latschenkiefer).
- Then you will  see the cross of the Kreuzspitze in fornt of you.
- Follow the path which is very narrow, exposed, and often stony. Be careful of loose ground.
- From here a ridge leads to the summit rock of the Kreuzspitze.
- The last bit requires climbing (**I**) and scrmabling to the to of the summit. Then a short, exposed, ridge path to the summit.

**Descent:**
The normal route for the descent is the same as the ascent.

**Huts/Stations:** None.

## Logbook:

### Hike 21.07.2020 - Kreuzspitze (2185m)
**Route:**  Parking area on the left side of the road 7km behind Linderhofi.e. Parkplatz Ammerwald (1080m) – über das Gries, Links – Hochgrießkar – Kreuzspitze (2185m) - Hochgrießkar - Gries - Parkplatz Ammerwald (1080m)

**Description:**
- I parked at Parkplatz Ammerwald (1080m) which lies on the left side of the road, approx. 7km behind Linderhof, and just behind the boarder.
- I started hiking at 9:10am.
- From the parking area I followed the yellow sign to the Kreuzspitze. First I crossed the Riverbed (i.e. **Gries**) and find the trail on the **left** side of the Riverbed. A trail starts to lead into the forest.
- The first part in the forest is nice and not too steep.
- After not very long the path gets steeper and we hike up the forest in lots serpentines.
- Then I reached the **Hochgrießkar** and the winding trail leads up the cirque (i.e.Kar) and it gets steeper and stony. Always follow the **red dots** and markings to stay on the trail.
- The paths leads out of the cirque into the mountain pine bushes (i.e. Latschenkiefer).
- Now I was able to see the cross of the Kreuzspitze and on the other side I had a great view.
- I followed the path that is very narrow, exposed, and often stony. I used my hands to keep my balance and prevent slipping away. Loose ground.
- From here a ridge leads to the summit rock of the Kreuzspitze.
- I reached the summit rock from which a climb/scramble would lead up to the summit. However, due to bad weather I had to turn around and hurry back down.

- In total I hiked from 9:15am to 1:00pm,(however, I didn't make it all the way up and had to turn around). Distance: 12.33km. Total elevation gain: 880hm. Highest point: 1977 m. Lowest Point: 1081 m.

- **In the future I would go here only with mountain boots (dt. Festen Bergschuhen). Moreover, the tour requires perfect weather conditions. If wet, and rain fall this exposed and slippery route can very dangers!**
