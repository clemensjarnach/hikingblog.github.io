The Lamsenspitze (2508m) is a beautiful mountain in the Karwendel and a great summit for any alpinist and climber out there. Routes to the top include a Via-Ferrata or Alpine Climbing Routes. The summit rewards the exertion with an incredible view.

<br>

**Route:**
Eng Hotel - Binsalm - Lamsenjoch – Lamsenjochhütte -  Brudertunnel or Normalweg – Lamsscharte – Lamsenspitze (2508m) - Descent via Normalweg; rest same as ascent.

**Map & Route Summary:**   [online at alpenvereinaktiv](https://www.alpenvereinaktiv.com/de/tour/lamsenspitze-am-2020-08-07/182428459/?share=%7Eznv3gjbe%244osspjow)

**Character:** The Lamsenspitze is an alpine mountaineering route of  medium difficulty (T3) with via ferrata sections 1) Normalweg (A-A/B), 2) Brudertunnel (B/C), and summit via-ferrata (B/C). Short sections to the summit without fixed rope (I).

This hike requires experience and a good head for heights due to exposed sections as well as experience in via-ferrata climbing.

**Drive to base:**
Address for car navigation: Hinterriß-Eng 1-2, 6215 Hinterriß, Austria. The parking lot of the hotel 'DIE ENG Alpengasthof und Naturhotel'.


**Ascent:**
From the parking lot of the Alpengasthof Eng you follow the signs to the Binsalm. A steep path starts just left after the 'Eng Alm' Gate. After the Binsalm you follow a small path that leads up a mountain field. The direction is always the Lamsenjoch / Lamsenjochhuette. Once you reach the Lamsenjoch, an almost horizontal path leads to the Lamsenjoch Hütte. From here you can already see the hut in the distance.

From the hut you have two options: 1) either you take the 'Normalweg' which leads up on crushed rocks (i.e. dt. Schotterfeld) right to the bottom of the East face (Ostwand). You cross the bottom of the East face and then an easy via-ferrata (A-A/B) leads to the Lamsenscharte. 2) Alternatively, you can take the exciting and slightly more difficult via-ferrata route via Brudertunnel (B/C). Both routes lead to the Lamsenscharte. From there you follow the path on loose rock (dt Geröllfeld) in West direction until you reach the access point of the via-ferrata for the summit ascent (B-B/C). Be careful of rock falls. Note. the via-ferrata to the summit of the lamsenspitze has been redirected and is now slightly more difficult, however, less exposed to rockfall. Old guides and books will say this via-ferat is easy (A-A/B), however, since 2020 is the grade more a (B/C-C).



**Descent:**
Descent as the same as the ascent. However, climbers who to the Brudertunnel Ferrata might want to take the Normalweg on the way down.
