| Weather Forecast: | [1) wetter.com](https://www.wetter.com/deutschland/kochel-am-see/kochel/DE0005655.html), 2) [DAV-Bergwetter](https://www.alpenverein.de/DAV-Services/Bergwetter/Allgaeu-Karwendel-Ammergau-Zugspitze-Arlberg/#2021-02-26)|


**Character:** Easy Hike/TrailRun, with no exposed sections, mostly forest road. From the Kesselberg parking space leads a broad forest road ('Forststraße') all the way up to the Berggasthaus Herzogstand (1560m). From there a narrower foot track leads to the summit; about 30 min.

The Herzogstand is highly popular, thus, not recommended for weekends, holidays, or other days when it can be expected that a lot of people will go hiking. This hike is suitable as a trail run due to the good road and no extreme steepness. Note: there is a lift going up from Walchensee. Thus, the summit may be even more busy due to a lot of tourists taking the lift up for the view.
The view from the summit to Kochelsee, Walchensee, Wetterstein, Estergebierge and the Karwendel is fantastic.


**Drive to base:**
Drive to Kochel and follow the B11 from Kochel to direction Wallgau. Just behind the highest point of the street, there are parking spaces on the side of the road. e.g. parking space Kesselberg. If you reach the Walchesee you are drove to far. Parking spaces are limited. (For navigation system:  Kesselbergstraße 7, 82431 Kochel )

**Route:**  Parkplatz Kesselberg (ca. 850m) Berggasthaus Herzogstand (1560m) – Herzogstand (1705m) - Descent same as Ascent

## Logbook:

### 03.03.2021 - Herzogstand (1731m)

**Description:**
-  I parked at the 'Parkplatz Kesselberg'. I started the trail run at 9:30am.
It took me exactly 1:37h to reach the summit; it was 11:13. I took a long break to enjoy the fantastic view.
the road up was at parts still with snow and sometimes even icy which made it at parts difficult with my trial running shoes. Even on this Wednesday morning, I encountered quite a bit of people on my way down. This really is one of the busiest and most popular mountains in the Bayerischen Voralpen.

We did not take long breaks on the way up. We were lucky and did not encounter a lot of people since it was a Wednesday afternoon. It was a surprisingly warm day in mid February with 17 degrees Celsius. The Mountain was almost clear of snow. We encountered only a few snow fields which however created no problems at all. The summit was snow free. After a nice break on the summit for ca 45min we started the descent at 17:00. At 18:13 we were back at the car. the descent took me bout 1h. I finished my work out when I reached the car after a total of 2:38 min exercise.
- In total I was hiking from 09:35 to 12:53. Total distance: 15km. Total elevation gain: 888hm.
