**Character:** This is a relatively easy ski tour and especially suitable for training purposes. It is possible to ascent on the side of the ski piste and due to the option of artificial snow is the piste relatively snow safe. Up to the Kolbensattel is practically no danger of avalanches.

**Variation** Once you reached the Kolbensattelhuette you can continue your way up to Am Zahn. After the Kolbensattelhuette you leave the slopes and you enter alpine territory.


**Drive to base:**
Drive to Oberammergau. Follow in Oberammergau the directions to the Kolbensesselbahn. (For navigation system: Kreislainenweg, 82487 Oberammergau)
