**Character:** Physically demanding mountain hike.  The ascent is partly very steep, however, there are no particularly exposed sections. Good training and very rewarding views from the summit.

**Video Description:** [YouTube](add )

**Drive to base:**
To Farchant; direction Bahnhofsstraße, then onto Mühldörflstraße. At the end of the road take a left to Kuhfluchtweg. Follow the road to the parking area of the Kuhflucht-wasserfall parkplatz.
Alternatively, you could start from Oberau.

**Approach:**
Approach is possible from Farchant (i.e. Ortsteil Mühldorf) or you could start from Oberau.

**Hike:**
From Farchant hike at the bottom of the mountain north in the direction of Oberau. Once you reach a small pond called 'Urspung', you will find a path on your right (east) leading up into the forest. Follow this trail, called the 'OberauerSteig'. At a hight of ca 1750hm you reach a saddle where a sign directs you west to the Hohen Fricken and east to the Bischof. From here you will have already a beautiful view into the surrounding mountain ranges.
Follow the sign east to the Bischof. Here you will hike up a trail leading you through 'Latschen' (i.e. pine bushes) until you reach the summit cross.

**Description:**
- A pretty exhausting hike, but Lauren and I had a lot of fun. The view was amazing and we were glad to have done another nice autumn hike.
- Conditions were good. It was muddy but mostly free of snow.
- I parked in Farchant, Ortsteil Mühldorf.
- 11:00 - we started hiking. Since it was a nice Autumn day we were able to start the hike that late. The Kuhflucht parking lot was full and we had to park on a side road. Kuhflucht was very busy, so, we decided to take the Oberausteig to the Bischof.
- 13:35 - we reached the saddle at a ca 1750hm where a sign directs you west to the Hohen Fricken and east to the Bischof. We took the path east to the summit of the Bischof.
- 14:30 - we reached the Bischof Summit Cross (2033m). It took us 3h30min to ascent
- we took the same route for our descent, i.e. via Oberausteig.
- 18:00 - we were back at the car. It was fully dark by now.

- **In total we hiked from 11:00am to 18:00. 3h 30min for the ascent. Distance: 20km. Total elevation gain: 1.440m. Highest point: 2.033m. Lowest Point: 572m**
