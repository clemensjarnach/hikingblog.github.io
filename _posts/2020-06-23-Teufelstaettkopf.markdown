The Teufelstättenkopf (1758m) close to Unterammergau is a summit with a great view. It starts with a beautiful hike through a gorge, the “Schleifmühlenklamm“. The majority of the hike is on good forest roads and paths. Only the last quarter is on a steep narrow track. To the summit leads a short scramble that is supported by fixed steel ropes.

The tour can be done as a loop. For the descent you can choose to hike down to the Pürschling (1566m)  and Albert-Schuster-Haus ()“Pürschling-Haus”, 1554m).
