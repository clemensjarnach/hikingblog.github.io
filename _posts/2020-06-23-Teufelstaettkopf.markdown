**Description:**
The Alpine Climbing Garden 'Himmelsburg' is located at the 'Alpspitzgebiet'. Routes are up to 40m long. The climbing garden has routes in the grades 4 to 7 UIAA. The climbing garden is in Alpine Environment which means general alpine dangers need to be considered. The climbing garden is great for training and practicing climbing in an aline environment. There are also a few places where you can practice skills such as abseiling, securing, belay stand construction, climbing training. e.g. there are blots close to the ground to practice belay stand construction (dt. Standplatzbau) etc.


**Drive to base:**
The climbing garden is at the Alpspitz area. Best approach is by taking the Alpspitzbahn to the summit station (dt. Gipfelstation). From there you can take a forest road in the direction to the 'Hochalm' (ca. 10 min). The climbing garden is on the left side.
