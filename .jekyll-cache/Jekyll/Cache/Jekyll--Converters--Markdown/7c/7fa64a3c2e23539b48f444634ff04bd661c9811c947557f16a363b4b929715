<p>This is a list of my favourite mountain hikes, climbs, scrambles, ski-tours, and places. This website includes my personal notes on the tours as well as links to important websites. Everyone is responsible for judging their own skill level and should plan appropriately. I am not a professional mountain guide, just a mountain enthusiast. This website is intended to be a place for my own notes and not necessarily as a guide for others.</p>

<p>If you have questions or recommendations <a href="https://clemjar.github.io/hikingblog.github.io/contact/">contact me</a>.</p>
