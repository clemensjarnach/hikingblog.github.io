<p><strong>Route:</strong>  Parking area Schloss Linderhof (900m) â€“ BrunnenkopfhÃ¼tte (1602m, 1:45h) â€“ GroÃŸe Klammspitze (1924m, 3:30h) â€“ Descent same as Ascent</p>

<p><strong>Character:</strong> The GroÃŸe Klammspitze is an alpine mountaineering route of  medium difficulty (T3). This hike requires experience and a good head for heights.</p>

<p><strong>Hike:</strong>
From the Linderhof parking area we follow the signs to <strong>Brunnenkopf</strong>. We follow the signs into the forest and hike on a broad forest path / gravel road. Shortly after we follow another sign and take a right into the forest. After 1h to 1.5h we reach the <strong>BrunnenkopfhÃ¼tte</strong> which lies at an elevation of 1602m. The path to the hut is very broad, and safe. The hike form the Linderhof parking area to the BrunnenkopfhÃ¼tte is easy and well suited for families or less experience hikers. Because of that it is also a quote busy route. You will have already a great view from the hut.
From the hut you can hike to the Brunnenkopf (20min). Or skip the Brunnenkopf and take a path left and follow the signs to <strong>Klammspitze</strong>. The trail starting at the hut leading to the Klammspitze is significantly narrower and at some parts steeper. Here is experience necessary. After significant volumes of rainfall the trail can washed-out which may make the trail more difficult and dangers. After just a few moment after leaving the hut you will see the summit of the GroÃŸe Klammspitze in front of you. We follow the hill-climbing which follows on the bottom of the Kleine Klammspitze and then starts to get steeper. The hill-climbing ground is full of loose and crushed rocks (dt. Schotter). We climb up the tor and rock. It is quite rocky and you will have to use your hands for balance. Always follow the red dots for orientation. Just below the summit you will have to scramble a little up to the rocky summit of the GroÃŸe Klammspitze. The climbing is never really difficult or dangers. However, you will need some experience and a good head for heights.</p>

<p><strong>Descent:</strong>
The normal route for the descent is the same as the ascent.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>I parked at the Kuhflucht parking area at the end fo the <strong>â€˜Kuhfluchtwegâ€™</strong> in Farchant, Ortsteil MÃ¼hldorf. Address for Car navigation is Farchant, Kuhfluchtweg.</li>
  <li>I started hiking at 9:00am.</li>
  <li>It was a very hot day. Luckily the majority of the ascent is in the forest and therefore in the shade. Nevertheless when I reached the Latschen (i.e. alpine pine bushes), it got really hot, as the bushes keep the heat and reflect it.</li>
  <li>It was quiet and a lonely hike. Not many hike from Farchant the very steep trail up to the Hoher Fricken. (You can alternatively take the Wank-Bahn and hike from the Wank summit on a ridge path to the Hoher Fricken).</li>
  <li>From the parking area I walked in the direction of the â€˜KuhfluchtwasserfÃ¤lleâ€™. Then I followed the <strong>â€˜KÃ¶nigswegâ€™</strong>. I reached and crossed a bridge an a trail starts and goes very steeply up through the forest.</li>
  <li>The trail is indeed very steep and I gained a lot of attitude meters in short time. The view to the Wettersteiggebirge and Alpspitze and Zugspitze is fantastic.</li>
  <li>The steep trail rewards you with a great view.</li>
  <li>I reached the summit of the <strong>Hoher Fricken</strong> at 11:40am.</li>
  <li>So, the ascent took me  2h 40mins.</li>
  <li>After a break and a sandwich I started to hike down from the Fricken-summit to the east in the direction of the Bischof-summit. I followed a nice and easy ridge trail. At the lowest point of the saddle are signs showing the way to the Bischof and to the Oberauer-Steig.  (This is the steig I will take down later).</li>
  <li>I followed the sign to the Bischof and it started to go uphill again. Its still a nice and not too difficult path up to the Bischof.</li>
  <li>I reached the <strong>Bischof</strong> Summit at 12:50 am.</li>
  <li>From there you have a beautiful view back to the Hoher Fricken, Wank, and the Wetterstein. In the other direction, north-east, you can see the other summits the Estergebirge, e.g. Henpeck, Kareck, oberer RiÃŸkopf, and Krottenkopf.</li>
  <li>After a short break I hiked back down again. 1) you have the option to decent the Bischof from the same way I cam up, reach the saddle again between Bischof and Fricken and follow the sign down via <strong>Oberauer-Steig</strong>. Thatâ€™s the way I took. 2) Alternativly, you can hike down the very steep Northside of the Bischof. So you hike down on loose stones and gravel until you reach a fork. You donâ€™t take the right path that leads to the Weilheimer HÃ¼tte. Instead you go left, west, in the direction of the Fricken. When you reach the Oberauer-Steig take the path down.</li>
  <li>The Oberauer-Steig is recommended as the path down, as this trail is not quite as steep as the trail we took up.</li>
  <li>Around 16:00 I was back down at the parking area.</li>
  <li>Because it was such a hot day, I cooled my feet in the Loisach. Highly recommend.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The hike is very steep an requires endurance. However, the steep trail rewards with a fantastic view from the summit.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>In total I hiked from 9:00am to 16:00 with 5:15h walking time. Distance: 16.25km. Total elevation: 1.504m. Highest point: 2.031m. Lowest Point: 587m</strong></li>
