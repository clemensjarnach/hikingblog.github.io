<p><strong>Route:</strong>  Farchat - Kuhflucht - Hoher Fricken - Bischof - Oberausteig - Farchat</p>

<ul>
  <li>I parked at the Kuhflucht parking area at the end fo the <strong>‘Kuhfluchtweg’</strong> in Farchant, Ortsteil Mühldorf. Address for Car navigation is Farchant, Kuhfluchtweg.</li>
  <li>I started hiking at 9:00am.</li>
  <li>It was a very hot day. Luckily the majority of the ascent is in the forest and therefore in the shade. Nevertheless when I reached the Latschen (i.e. alpine pine bushes), it got really hot, as the bushes keep the heat and reflect it.</li>
  <li>It was quiet and a lonely hike. Not many hike from Farchant the very steep trail up to the Hoher Fricken. (You can alternatively take the Wank-Bahn and hike from the Wank summit on a ridge path to the Hoher Fricken).</li>
  <li>From the parking area I walked in the direction of the ‘Kuhfluchtwasserfälle’. Then I followed the ‘Königsweg’. I reached and crossed a bridge an a trail starts and goes very steeply up through the forest.</li>
  <li>The trail is indeed very steep and I gained a lot of attitude meters in short time. The view to the Wettersteiggebirge and Alpspitze and Zugspitze is fantastic.</li>
  <li>The steep trail rewards you with a great view.</li>
  <li>I reached the summit of the Hoher Fricken at 11:40am.</li>
  <li>So, the ascent took me  2h 40mins.</li>
  <li>After a break and a sandwich I started to hike down from the Fricken-summit to the east in the direction of the Bischof-summit. I followed a nice and easy ridge trail. At the lowest point of the saddle are signs showing the way to the Bischof and to the Oberauer-Steig.  (This is the steig I will take down later).</li>
  <li>I followed the sign to the Bischof and it started to go uphill again. Its still a nice and not too difficult path up to the Bischof.</li>
  <li>I reached the Bischof Summit at 12:50 am.</li>
  <li>From there you have a beautiful view back to the Hoher Fricken, Wank, and the Wetterstein. In the other direction, north-east, you can see the other summits the Estergebirge, e.g. Henpeck, Kareck, oberer Rißkopf, and Krottenkopf.</li>
  <li>After a short break I hiked back down again. 1) you have the option to decent the Bischof from the same way I cam up, reach the saddle again between Bischof and Fricken and follow the sign down via <strong>Oberauer-Steig</strong>. That’s the way I took. 2) Alternativly, you can hike down the very steep Northside of the Bischof. So you hike down on loose stones and gravel until you reach a fork. You don’t take the right path that leads to the Weilheimer Hütte. Instead you go left, west, in the direction of the Fricken. When you reach the Oberauer-Steig take the path down.</li>
  <li>The Oberauer-Steig is recommended as the path down, as this trail is not quite as steep as the trail we took up.</li>
  <li>Around 16:00 I was back down at the parking area.</li>
  <li>Because it was such a hot day, I cooled my feet in the Loisach. Highly recommend.</li>
  <li>The hike is very steep an requires endurance. However, the steep trail rewards with a fantastic view fomr the summit.</li>
</ul>

<p>—&gt; In total I hiked from 9:00am to 16:00 with 5:15h walking time. Distance: 16.25km. Total elevation: 1.504m. Highest point: 2.031m. Lowest Point: 587m</p>
